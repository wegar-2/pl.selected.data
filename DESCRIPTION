Description: This package contains various data on Polish economy.
    Selected monthly and quarterly time series have been picked using the 
    following data sources: Narodowy Bank Polski (National Bank of Poland: https://www.nbp.pl/) 
    and Główny Urząd Statystyczny (Central Statistical Office: https://stat.gov.pl/).
    Please note that the data scope is by no means fully exhaustive (not all the data 
    published by GUS and NBP are contained in the package datasets).
    Last but not least, it is acknowledged that I am not the owner of the data contained
    in the package.
    Note that the scripts inside the package were used to create the data.tables 
    from the source CSV files.
    The CSV files ("R" folder) were manually compiled by the author.
